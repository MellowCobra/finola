# Finola

    What kind of curse is that? To be
      a swan, rambling from lake to lake,
    seems more desirable to me
      than being man of human make.

                       - Frank L. Ludwig

Fionnghuala (anglicized to Finola) was the only daughter of Lir, the old Irish god of the sea. She and her three brothers were cursed by their aunt/step-mother, who was jealous of the love Lir bore them, and turned them into swans. Finola protected her brothers as they spent 300 years each on three different bodies of water, never allowed to return to land until a total of 9 centuries had passed.

For our purposes, Finola is the compiler of our high-level programming language that compiles down to web assembly.

Some things I still need to determine:

-   What language should I write the compiler in?
-   What major language features would I like Finola to have?
-   Should I name the compiler Finola and the language Swan? Perhaps vice versa?
